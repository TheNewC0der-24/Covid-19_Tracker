## About
Covid is the largest category for an RNA virus. In most cases, it is difficult to detect if coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus is causing you fever.
Known as “COVID-19”, the newly identified coronavirus can cause pneumonia, and like other respiratory infections, it has an incubation of between 1 and 14 days.

>_It is the web application used to track Covid-19 stats all over the world._

## Features
In this Web-Application, you can see Covid-19 stats all over the world. Also, you can see stats by a particular country by changing Global to your specific Country. 
To show the Graph I use `Apex Chart`. And to show all the numbers and I am using [Covid-19 API](https://covid19api.com/ "Covid-19 API"). 

**You can see this application in _Dark_ and _Light_ mode both.**
